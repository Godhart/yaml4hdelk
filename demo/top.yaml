      # This time net is specified via dict. `r` in the end of `src` and `dst` means that value is treated as regex
      # And since it's regex - `.` is replaced here with `\.` to indicate that it's unit's port
      # NOTE: Those regexes selects only single item for src and dst
      #       BUT endpoint that are specified as regexes will NEVER add missing units/ports
      #       so regexes could be used for this (i.e. avoiding adding unwanted missing units/ports)
      #       besides their main purpose
      - {srcr: \.OUT, dstr: U3\.IN}

  U3: # Inline nested unit

      # In case if some alterations are required to already specified by file unit
      # Do following 'magic' (NOTE: order of `source` and `merge` nodes DOES maters):

  # This is a dict with regexes for source and destination.
  # Nets would be labeled as "CLOCK"
  # It connects all CLK ports of nested units to CLK port of top unit
  # NOTE: there is A space in `name: CLOCK` so it's a valid dict member
  - {src: .CLK, dstr: \w+\.CLK, name: CLOCK}

  # This is a list with regexes for source and destination.
  # Nets would be labeled as "RESET"
  # It connects all RST ports of nested units to RST port of top unit
  # NOTE: there is no space in `label:RESET` so it's scalar value (otherwise it would be a dict and would break tool)
  # NOTE: -regex makes both src and dst regex so it's necessary to escape dot ('.') to avoid unwanted matching effects
  - [\.RST, \w+\.RST, -regex, name:RESET]
